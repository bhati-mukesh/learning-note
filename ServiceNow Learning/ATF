- Service Catalog in Service Portal
- Application Navigator
- Custom UI
- Form
- Service Catalog
- Forms in Service Portal
- REST
- Server 

ATF Application and modules
- Tests 
- Suites
- Test Results
- Parameterized Test Results
- Suite Results
- Schedules
- Manual Page Inspector (use for custom UI page testing)




DisAdvantage:
- We can't run 2 test at same time
- SOAP Testing is not possible
 

Example
- Created First Test with SAAS demo test



Steps involved in ATF
- create a Test
- Add steps to the test
- run the test
- view the progress
- view the result
- if any error, check the screenshot


Step by step test building with different configurations
# step configuration categories
- Application Navigation - (Application menu visibility, module visibilty, navigate to module)
- Form (open a new form, open an existing record, filed values validation. field state validation, add attachment to form,click modal button, click a ui action, submit a form)
- Server (create a user, impersonate, search for a catalog item, record query, record insert, record update, record validation, run server side script, replay request item, log, add attachment to existing record, checkout shopping cart)
- Service Catalog (open a catalog item, open a record producer, set variable values, set catalog item quantity, validate variable values, variable state validation, validate price and recurring price, add item to shooping cart, order catalog item, submit record poducer)
- Service Catalog in service Portal (open a record producer, open a catalog item, open an order guide, add row to multi-row variable set, save current row of multi-row variable set, set variable values , validate variables values, variable state validation,validate price and recurring price, navigate within order guide,set catalog item quantity,review order guide summary, review item in order guide, add item to shopping cart, add order guide to shopping cart, submit an order guide, submit record producer)
- Service Portal
- Custom ui
- REST (send rest request -inbound- rest api explorer, send rest request -inbound, asser status code, assert status code name, assert response time,assert response header, assert response json payload is valid, assert response xml payload is well formed, assert xml payload element, assert json response payload element, assert response payload)
