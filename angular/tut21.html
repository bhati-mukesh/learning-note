  Python is an interpreted, high-level, general-purpose programming language. 
  Created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991,
   Python's design philosophy emphasizes code readability 
   with its notable use of significant whitespace. Its language
    constructs and object-oriented approach aim to help programmers
     write clear, logical code for small and large-scale projects.[28]
Python is dynamically typed and garbage-collected. It supports multiple 
programming paradigms, including procedural, object-oriented, and functional
 programming. Python is often described as a "batteries included" language
  due to its comprehensive standard library.[29]
Python was conceived in the late 1980s as a successor to the ABC language. 
Python 2.0, released in 2000, introduced features like list comprehensions 
and a garbage collection system capable of collecting reference cycles.
 Python 3.0, released in 2008, was a major revision of the language that 
 is not completely backward-compatible, and much Python 2 code does not 
 run unmodified on Python 3.
The Python 2 language, i.e. Python 2.7.x, was officially discontinued
 on 1 January 2020 (first planned for 2015) after which security
  patches and other improvements will not be released for it.[30][31] 
  With Python 2's end-of-life, only Python 3.5.x[32] and later are supported.
Python interpreters are available for many operating systems. A global
 community of programmers develops and maintains CPython,
  an open source[33] reference implementation.
   A non-profit organization, the Python Software Foundation, manages 
   and directs resources for Python and CPython development.
   Python was conceived in the late 1980s[34] by Guido van Rossum
    at Centrum Wiskunde & Informatica (CWI) in the Netherlands as 
    a successor to the ABC language (itself inspired by SETL),[35] 
    capable of exception handling and interfacing with the Amoeba 
    operating system.[8] Its implementation began in December 1989
    .[36] Van Rossum shouldered sole responsibility for the project, as the lead 
    developer, until 12 July 2018, when he announced his "permanent vacation" from 
    his responsibilities as Python's Benevolent Dictator For Life, a title the Python
     community bestowed upon him to reflect his long-term commitment as the project's
      chief decision-maker.[37] He now shares his leadership as a member of a five-person
       steering council.[38][39][40] In January 2019, active Python core developers elected Br
       ett Cannon, Nick Coghlan, Barry Warsaw, Carol Willing and Van Rossum to a five-member "
       Steering Council" to lead the project.[41]
Python 2.0 was released on 16 October 2000 with many major new feature
s, including a cycle-detecting garbage collector and support for Unicode.[42]
Python 3.0 was released on 3 December 2008. It was a major revision of the lang
uage that is not completely backward-compatible.[43] Many of its major features were backported to Python 2.6.x[44] and 2.7.x version series. Releases of Python 3 include the 2to3 utility, which automates (at least partially) the translation of Python 2 code to Python 3.[45]
Python 2.7's end-of-life date was initially set at 2015 then postponed
 to 2020 out of concern that a large body of existing code could not ea
 sily be forward-ported to Python 3.[46][47]
